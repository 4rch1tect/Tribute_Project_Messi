            <h2 id="tribute-info" class="text">Here is why Messi deserves the title of the G.O.A.T</h2> <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Barcelona’s number 10, Messi has already recorded the most titles (34), most wins, most goals (672)

                <br>
                <li>Messi is the only footballer to win four prestigious awards : Ballon d’Or, FIFA World Player,

                    history of the game. The second spot on this list is reserved by Portuguese great Cristiano Ronaldo,
                    who
                    has won the prestigious trophy five times.</li>
                <br>
